    "In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses **objects and classes** in programming. It aims to **implement real-world entities** like **inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation** etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to **bind the data and the functions** that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. "
